To encourage use of our Big Data cluster, we at ACCRE have gathered various 
large datasets and made them publicly available at `hdfs:///data`. 

## Stack Archives


## New York City Taxi LC


## Human Microbiome Project

## Conclusions

If you have a fairly generic dataset that you'd like us to grab, or if you have
your own data that you'd like to share on our cluster, reach out to us at the
